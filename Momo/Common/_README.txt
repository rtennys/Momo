The contents of this folder were created from a NuGet package called
RobTennyson.Common.  The classes are those I tend to pull along with
me to every project I'm a part of. I got tired of re-writing them or
having to hunt for the latest and greatest versions so I packaged
them up.

Since they are my personal collection, the NuGet package contents are
subject to change on a whim and without notice. If you're reading
this, I was either a consultant for you or your employer on this
project, or you purposely downloaded the package (cool with me).
Either way, update with extreme caution!

There is no copyright whatsoever. You're welcome to just ignore the
fact that the classes came from my NuGet package and start hacking
them up to fit your needs. Though if I come back to work on your
project, I might lose all of your work when I update to the latest
version :)
